# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the “Energy Levels” Health Insights tile on the /home dashboard with “PCOD & PCOS Risks” and update its click handler/logging references accordingly.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Health Insights grid tile label from “Energy Levels” to “PCOD & PCOS Risks” on /home.
- Update the replaced tile’s click handler/log message so it references PCOD & PCOS risks (and no longer references energy predictions), without changing other user-facing text beyond the tile label.

**User-visible outcome:** On the /home dashboard, the Health Insights tile now shows “PCOD & PCOS Risks,” and clicking it triggers the corresponding PCOD/PCOS risks handler/logging.
