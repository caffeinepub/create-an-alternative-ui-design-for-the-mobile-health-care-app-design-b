  "summary": "Diff implements a local demo credential store (phone+password), adds a new /signup route and SignUp page, extends session handling with a password session type, updates route guarding to accept local sessions, and updates DesignBAppShell to hide navigation on /signup. SignIn is updated to include password sign-in while retaining existing options per file summary, but some UI details are truncated so a few AC items cannot be fully verified from shown code.",

      "description": "Added an account lookup helper (getAccount) in the demo credential store, which was not explicitly requested.",
