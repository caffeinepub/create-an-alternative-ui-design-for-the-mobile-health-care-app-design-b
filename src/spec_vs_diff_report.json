  "summary": "REQ-1 asks to resolve deployment-blocking errors so a fresh full-stack deploy succeeds. The diff shows substantial backend and frontend application changes (authorization/profile APIs, routing/provider restructuring) but provides no clear evidence of fixing a specific compile/build/config/deploy error or of changes targeted at deployment stability. Several changes also look like new functionality rather than deployment fixes.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Resolve any errors that prevent a successful deploy so the full stack (Motoko canister + React frontend assets) builds and deploys cleanly; fix the underlying cause of prior compile/build/config errors (not just re-run).",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any explicit fixes to deployment/build configuration or specific compile errors (e.g., dfx config, canister settings, build scripts, dependency/version fixes). It only shows application-level code changes without evidence they address the prior deployment-blocking issue or ensure a clean deploy.",

      "description": "New/changed frontend routing setup using @tanstack/react-router and reorganized provider/layout composition (DesignBAppShell, ThemeProvider, QueryClientProvider, InternetIdentityProvider, Toaster).",
      "reason": "REQ-1 does not request a routing refactor or design system/layout changes; this appears to be functionality/architecture work beyond deployment-error resolution (unless tied to an error, which is not evidenced in the diff).",
